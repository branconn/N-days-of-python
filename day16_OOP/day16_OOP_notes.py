# Day 16: Object Oriented Programming
# NOTES & CHALLENGES

# """NOTES
# what we have been doing up until this point is procedural programming
# procedures/functions do things. This is one of hte earliest paradigms
# Increase in complexity makes procedural increasingly difficult to follow
# How do we manage relationships while we increase complexity?
# Object oriented paradigm
# example: self driving car
#     camera system
#     lane guidance system
#     navigation
#     fuel management
# teams and sub-teams working on modules
# with reusable modules
# OOP lets you modularize
# OOP: don't need to know the details (abstraction)
#
# How to use OOP:
# trying to model a real-world object
# an object has things (attributes) and does things (methods)
# attributes = object's variables
# methods = object's functions
#
# you can multiple versions of an objects
# a CLASS is a type (e.g. waiter), an OBJECT is an individual instance of that CLASS (e.g. Henry)
# """
# object = Class()
# car = CarBlueprint()

# adding packages:
# files are modules
# packages are collections of modules
