## STEP 1: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yesterday's closing stock price.

parameters = {
    "function": "TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED",
    "symbol": STOCK,
    "apikey": STOCK_API,
}

        latest -= datetime.timedelta(days=1)
    else:
        weekday = True
pre_latest = latest - datetime.timedelta(days=1)
weekday = False
while not weekday:
    dow = pre_latest.isoweekday()
    if dow > 5:
        pre_latest -= datetime.timedelta(days=1)
    else:
        weekday = True
t_close = ticker_values[str(latest)]["4. close"]
t1_close = ticker_values[str(pre_latest)]["4. close"]
delt = float(t_close)/float(t1_close) - 1
if abs(delt) >= 0.05:
    print("Movement")
else:
    print("Nominal fluctuations")


## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator



## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
#HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.



#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
